# co2milxly
A small project to convert the KML files generated by Command Ops 2's `GameStateExporter.exe` to MilX file format supported by `map.army`.

## Installation
You need the following on your computer to run this tool:
```
 - python3
 - lxml (pip install lxml)
```

## Usage
If running locally, simply do: `python3 ./kml2milx.py <your input kml> <name of output milx file>`.

## How does it work?
This tool uses a custom rule set(inside `co2milx.txt`) to generate MilX units. Since the ruleset is quite small right now, you *might* face errors. To fix this, either:
 - Open a new issue on github
 - Contact Serpent on CO2 discord
 - Open map.army, and then manually check what the code for that unit is, and add it to your local rule set.

## Future TODO ideas
 - Host this tool on a website for everyone to use.
 - Keep a historical track of all units and record when a friendly unit surrendered, and how exactly they moved and where.
 - Generate a convex hull/envelope around the friendly troops to simulate the area of influence on the map. Possibly inside another layer.
